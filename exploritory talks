principles of analytic graphics
evidence = relative
box plots

1. show comparison
2. show causality
3. show multivariate data
4. Integrate evidence (words,numbers, images, diagrams, try to put lots of info on your plots!!)
5. describe and document the evidence
6. Content is king (what is the content, what is the best way to present it?)

exploratory graphs:
-made quickly, personal understanding

pollution <- read.csv("data/avgpm25.csv", colClasses = c("numeric", "character","factor","numeric","numberic"))
head(pollution)

summaries of data: 5 number summary, boxplots, histograms, density plot, barplot

1. summary = summary(), summary (pollution$pm25)
2. boxplot = boxplot(), boxplot (pollution$pm25, col = "blue")
3 histogram = hist(), hist(polluion$pm25, col = "green")
#you can change the breaks in a histogram
hist(), hist(polluion$pm25, col = "green", breaks)
rug(pollution$pm25) (shows where the data is concentrated at!!)
or a abline()
abline(h = 12)

graphing part 2: two dimensional summaries
multiple/overlayed (ggplot2)
spinning plots
coplots

-"~" (tilde) used to separate parts of a model
boxplot(pm25 ~ region, data = pollution, col = "red")
par(mfrow = c(2,1), mar = c(4,4,2,1))

with(subset(pollution, region == "west"), plot(latitude, pm25, main = "west"))
with(subset(pollution, region == "east"), plot(latitude, pm25, main = "east"))

Core plotting systems in R!!!
1. Bas Plotting System: artist palette model, use annotation functions (text,lines,points, axis); start with the plot function
-an increasing process, hard to add to another plot

2. Lattice System (comes from single function call) (xyplot,bwplot,etc.); ex. see how y changes across z, panel plots, can not add to a plot once it is done

library(lattice)
state <- data.frame(state.x77, region = state.region)
xyplot(Life.Exp ~ Income | region, data = state, layout = c(4,1))

3. ggplot2 system: splits diff bet base and lattice
-can add things one by one

library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg)

'////////////////////////////////////////

Base Plotting System in R: uses plot, hist, boxplot
Lattice(uses lattice and grid packages)
-do you need to resize it?

base graphics(two dimensional)
1. Initatize
2. annotate a plot

library(datasets)
hist(airquality)

With(airquality$Ozone, plot(....))
or
airquality <- transform(airquality, Month = faactor(Month))
boxplot(Ozone)

plotting functions with base: 
1. pch(); dot, or other method to plot
2. lty()
3. lwd()
4. col(), plotting color; use color() to get color by name
5. xlab() string for x
6. ylab() string for y

important base graphic terms
1. las = orientation
2. bg = background color
3. mar = margin
4. oma = outer margin
5. mfrow = # of polots per row (plots filled row wise)
6. mfcol = # of polots per row (plots filled column wise)

#par(): this can be used to determine defautl global value

plot functions
1. plot()
2. lines() adds lines to plot
3. points() add points to plot (different group or subset)
4. text(): add labels to the plot
5. mtext(): add texts to margins of the plot
6. title(): adds title to plot

library(datasets)
with(airquality,plot(Wind, Ozone))
title(main = "Ozone and Wind Quality")
#can also add main directly into with statement
with(airquality, plot(Ozone, Wind, main = "Ozone and Wind Quality"))

with(subset(airquality, Month == 5), points(Wind, Ozone, col = "blue"))
###or

with(airquality,plot(Wind, Ozone, main = "Ozone and Wind Quality", type = "n"))
with(subset(airquality, Month ==5), points(Ozone, Wind, col = "blue"))
with(subset(airquality, !Month ==5), points(Ozone, Wind, col = "Red"))
legend("topright", pch = 1, col = c("blue, "red"), legend = c("May", "Other Months"))

if you want multiple plots, use the mfrow function, and call the plot multiple times
#////////////////////////////////

xyplot(): for scatterplots
bwlot: box and whiskers
histogram
stripplotg: box plot with actual points


xyplot(y ~ x | f*g, data)


lattice: xyplot, bwplot
